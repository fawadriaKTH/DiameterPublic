# DiameterPublic
The python source code of the algorithms used in the paper 'Diameter Minimization by Shortcutting with Degree Constraints'.

TestGraph.txt is adjacency list representation of the input graph.

'logkapprox' function is Algorithm 1 from the paper
'addEdges_biggesttoAll' function is Algorithm 2 from the paper
'heuristic_two_sweep' function is Algorithm 3 from the paper.

All functions return an augmented graph (the original graph + k new edges) data structure in NetworkX ('Hnew').
